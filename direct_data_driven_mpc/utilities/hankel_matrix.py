    Construct a Hankel matrix from the input data matrix `X` with a window
    length `L`. The matrix `X` consists of a sequence of `N` elements, each of
    length `n`.
    
    Args:
        X (np.ndarray): Input data matrix of shape (N, n), where N is the
            number of elements, and n is the length of each element.
        L (int): Window length for the Hankel matrix.
    
    Returns:
        np.ndarray: A Hankel matrix of shape (L * n, N - L + 1), where each 
            column represents a flattened window of length L sliding over the
            N data elements.

            L, indicating that the window length exceeds the available data
            length.
